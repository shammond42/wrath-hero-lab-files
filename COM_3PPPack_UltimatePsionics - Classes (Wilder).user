  <thing id="cWldWildSu" name="Wild Surge" description="A wilder can let her passion and emotion rise to the surface in a wild surge when she manifests a power. During a wild surge, a wilder gains phenomenal psionic strength, but may harm herself by the reckless use of her power (see Psychic Enervation, below).\n\nA wilder can choose to invoke a wild surge whenever she manifests a power. When she does so, she gains +1 to her manifester level with that manifestation of the power. The manifester level boost gives her the ability to augment her powers to a higher degree than she otherwise could; however, she pays no extra power point for this wild surge. Instead, the additional 1 power point that would normally be required to augment the power is effectively supplied by the wild surge.\n\nLevel-dependent power effects are also improved, depending on the power a wilder manifests with her wild surge.\n\nThis improvement in manifester level does not grant her any other benefits outside of the manifestation (she gains no higher-level class abilities, for instance).\n\nShe cannot use the Overchannel psionic feat and invoke her wild surge at the same time.\n\nAt 3rd level, a wilder boosts her manifester level by two instead of one. At 7th level, she boosts her manifester level by three; at 11th level, by four; at 15th level, by five; and at 19th level, by six. The wilder always wild surges for the maximum amount possible, for unleashing emotions in the fashion of a wild surge does not lend itself to using finesse.\n\nIn all cases, the wild surge effectively pays the extra power point cost that is normally required to augment the power by this additional amount; only the standard power point cost is subtracted from the wilder&apos;s power point reserve. For example, if Alrik the 8th level wilder were to invoke his wild surge when manifesting a power, he would spend between 1 and 8 power points as normal, but the power would manifest at 11th manifester level and behave as if he had spent 3 more on it than normal.\n\nThe wilder can expend her psionic focus to manifest a psionic power without expending any power points, powering the manifestation with only her wild surge. She manifests this power as if all power points were paid by her wild surge ability. This results in the power being manifested as if the base power point cost of the power was paid, along with augmentation equal to her wild surge amount, but she may not augment the power beyond the amount of her wild surge, and when checking for psychic enervation, the chance to be overcome doubles to 30%. A wilder must wait 10 minutes after wild surging in this fashion before she can do so again." compset="ClSpecial" summary="You can gain a boost to your psychic power.">

  <thing id="cWldPUChSu" name="Chaotic Surge" description="{b}Wild Surge and Psychic Enervation{/b}: The chaotic wilder unlocks ways to increase her manifester level beyond the dreams of most wilders, but doing so is even more dangerous. When the chaotic wilder invokes a wild surge, she rolls a d4. If the result is a 1, the chaotic wilder&apos;s power manifests at one manifester level lower than normal. If this would result in a manifester level too low to manifest the power, the wilder is shaken until the start of her next turn and the power fails, although the chaotic wilder does not spend any power points. If the result is a 2 or 3, the chaotic wilder&apos;s manifester level is improved by 1. If the result is a 4, the chaotic wilder&apos;s manifester level is improved by 2. When the chaotic wilder&apos;s wild surge improves (3rd, 7th, 11th, 15th, and 19th levels) or when using perfect surge, treat each bonus the same way. For example, at 7th level, a result of 1 would mean the manifester level is reduced by 3, a result of 2-3 would mean the manifester level is increased by 3, while a result of 4 would mean the manifester level is increased by 6. Because the chaotic wilder has less control over her wild surge than most wilders, she has a 25% chance of triggering psychic enervation. When the chaotic wilder triggers psychic enervation, she is affected based upon her wild surge roll. On a 1, she is dazed until the start of her next turn.

As such, Heal is added as a class skill for pain wilders, and they gain a +4 competence bonus on any use of the skill that involves surgery. Likewise, if a pain wilder makes any use of Intimidate that involves inflicting pain on the target, she also gains a +4 competence bonus on the check. The pain wilder&apos;s ability to choose how much damage is inflicted applies in these circumstances.\n\nFor example, a pain wilder attempting to remove a barbed sting that will inflict 1d6 damage on withdrawal would gain a +4 advantage to her Heal check to withdraw it, and could choose how much damage to inflict if successful or not." compset="ClSpecial" summary="Determine exactly how much damage to inflict on a willing or helpless subject.">
