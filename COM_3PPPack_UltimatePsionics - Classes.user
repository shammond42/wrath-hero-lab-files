Essentially, the character gains something akin to the Leadership feat, but with some important differences. \n\nThose who answer a thrallherd&apos;s call are not referred to as cohorts and followers, but rather as thralls and believers, respectively. They do not appear because they admire the character and want to serve her, but because a hidden psychic resonance connects the thrallherd and her servants.\n \nAs with the Leadership feat, a thrallherd has a Leadership score that determines the highest-level thrall and believers she can attract. A thrallherd&apos;s Leadership score is equal to her character level + her Charisma modifier + her thrallherd level. (Note that her thrallherd level is counted twice.) This score is not affected by any of the modifiers mentioned in the Leadership feat.\n\nAs with the Leadership feat, the called thrall&apos;s level is limited, even if the character&apos;s Leadership score would indicate a higher-level thrall. Unlike with the Leadership feat, the level limit of a thrall is equal to the character&apos;s total level minus 1 (not level minus 2, as is true for cohorts).\n\nA thrallherd cannot take the Leadership feat; if the character already has it, the feat is lost and replaced by this ability; those who were previously cohorts and followers go their separate ways, and those who are more mentally pliable show up later to take up roles as thralls and believers. A thrallherd&apos;s thrall and believers arrive within 24 hours. Lost thralls are replaced within 24 hours. Believers arrive and are replaced at a rate of the thrallherd&apos;s leadership score per day, with the lowest level believers arriving first. If the thrallherd is in a location where thralls and believers cannot reach, none arrive until she moves to a location where she can be reached.\n\nA thrallherd establishes a resonance with his thrall and suffers if the thrall is killed. For 48 hours following the loss of a thrall, a thrallherd suffers one negative level. This negative level may not be healed by any means until 48 hours have passed since the thrall&apos;s death, at which point it fades naturally. Should the thrallherd&apos;s new thrall die while the thrallherd is still suffering a negative level, he acquires an additional negative level, and the duration of any negative levels gained through losing a thrall resets to 48 hours from the time the most recent thrall was lost.\n\nUse the above table instead of the one with the Leadership feat to determine the level of a thrallherd&apos;s thrall and the number of believers of various levels a thrallherd can attract." compset="ClSpecial">

If a member of the collective is affected by a magical or psionic effect with a duration greater than 1 round, the tactician can echo it onto another member of his collective. To do so, the tactician must first identify the power properly (see the Spellcraft skill description).\n\nEchoing a magical or psionic effect is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity and costs the tactician a number of power points equal to the original effect&apos;s caster or manifester level (whichever applies). As a supernatural ability, a tactician is permitted to spend more power points than his manifester level on this effect.\n\nThe new target must be legal for the effect in question (for instance, if you attempt to echo an unaugmented {i}empathic connection{/i} on a dog, the echo will fail). If the effect allows a saving throw, the new target is entitled to a saving throw when the effect is echoed (same DC as the original power).\n\nOnly the basic effect and augmentation are echoed; metamagic and metapsionic feats do not echo. The echo has all the same decisions made as the original. For example, {i}specified energy adaptation{/i} echoes would guard against the same energy type, while a 5pp {i}empathic connection{/i} (extended duration) could not be echoed as a 5pp {i}empathic connection{/i} (affects aberrations). The echo takes effect at the same caster or manifester level as the originator. When the original ends or leaves the collective, all echoes of it also end.

A Diminutive lock usually has AC 7, and larger locks have a lower AC. The lock gains a bonus to its AC against this attack based on its quality.

On a hit, the gunslinger does not damage the object with the shot, but can move it up to 15 feet farther away from the shot&apos;s origin. On a miss, she damages the object normally.\n\n{i}Stop Bleeding{/i}: The gunslinger makes a firearm attack and then presses the hot barrel against herself or an adjacent creature to staunch a bleeding wound.

You must have line of sight to each target, each target must have a Wisdom score of at least 1, and all targets must be within Medium range (100 ft. + 10 ft. per class level). The collective can contain up to your relevant ability modifier (determined by class) or half your level (minimum 1), whichever is higher. If you are a zealot, add the intensity of your zeal to this limit.  You are always considered a member of your own collective, and do not count against this limit. \n\nYou can choose to remove a member as a free action on your turn, and any member can voluntarily leave the collective as a free action on their turn. Any member whose Wisdom drops to zero or who moves out of range of the collective is automatically removed. If a member enters a null psionics field, the connection to the collective is suppressed until the member leaves the field. A member who leaves the collective for any reason immediately loses any and all benefits they may have gained from being a member. You are aware of the status of his collective and can, roughly, sense the presence of each member, although beyond telling if such a creature is still a member, this has no mechanical benefit until higher levels (see telepathy below).\n\nIf you are capable of manifesting powers, casting spells, or initiating maneuvers, any compatible spell, power, or maneuver with a range greater than touch can be used through the collective. You may manifest any power with the Network Descriptor this way, regardless of their actual ranges or targets.\n\nIf a member of the collective dies, the member is removed from the collective and you must make a Fortitude save (DC 15) or lose 1 power point for every Hit Die of the fallen member or be sickened for an equal number of rounds.\n\nAt 15th level, your collective range is limitless on the same plane as you.\n\nAt 19th level, your range reaches even across other planes and dimensions." compset="ClSpecial">

A mindleap contingent power, once manifest, lies dormant, undetectable and undispellable, for up to five minutes (after which time it fades harmlessly), or until the body snatcher leaves her current body via mind switch (either to return to her original body or to possess another). Immediately after the switch occurs, the mindleap contingency triggers, and the linked power takes effect on the body she was in when she established the contingency. Any choices to be made about the effect must be made when the power is manifest, not when it triggers. Saving throws made against a mindleap contingent power suffer a -5 penalty due to the sudden shift in bodies.\n  For example, Valis the telepath/body snatcher has already mind switched with a subject and is about to shift her mind back to her body. She manifests memory modification (opting to erase the memory of her time in the body) on her current (host) body as a mindleap contingency, after which she returns her mind to her native body. The subject, upon return to its body, is affected by the memory modification power, and must make a Will save (at -5) or be forced to forget the experience.\n  Using this ability is akin to using a metapsionic feat – a body snatcher must expend her psionic focus when establishing a mindleap contingency, and establishing one increases the power&apos;s power point cost by 4." compset="ClSpecial">

In some ways, this is literal truth for a body snatcher, although she tends to see only opportunity. Immediately upon being reduced to -1 hit points or lower, or failing a saving throw against an effect that would kill her, a 6th level body snatcher may expend her psionic focus to manifest true mind switch as an immediate action at the same manifester level she manifests mind switch. She may only target her killer with this effect (thus, if the killer is out of range, this ability is worthless), and the save DC is reduced by 4 due to the desperate nature of this technique. If successful, her mind immediately switches places with\nher killer&apos;s and her old body dies.
