</ul>

<li>Golden Glyph Publishing (ShadowChemosh) - Added the Lagos race. Note this is only about 80% complete from the PDF. Future update will finish adding it.</li>

<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - #119 Aegis aberrant archetype fixed. Changes to the archetype where pretty big but will allow me to more easily support the archetype now and in the future. Unfortunately this means existing characters that have this archetype will be required to re-add any customizations they had taken previously. In the good news they all are now fully scripted. Very sorry for any issues this causes!</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - Fixed spellcasting for shadow heroes.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Custom Dorje's have been added! This can be found on the Magic tab as "- Add Custom Dorje -" and will function just like buying a wand except you can add powers instead. Currently the "CL" is still getting displayed instead of ML.</li>

<strong>v1.15 January 29, 2018</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - Tagged some item powers to move into equip categories.</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - More magic item fixes.</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - Feats updated. Made sure the feats are all tagged in correct category and working. Once I start on the class updates, there will be a few more updates to a few feats.</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - Updates to the Modern template</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - Updated some tags, the modern template and hide PL5 gear for the PL4 setting.</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - The MSRD classes had a rebuild, so you might need to update you old MSRD characters. This was done to get everything to work well together and add the Anachronistic classes soon.</li>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - A source was missing for the bodyguard class that caused errors.</li>
<li>Unchained (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed warpriest "Sacred Fist" archetype to correctly handle style
feats.  Thanks to Valdacil for the help on this one!</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #131. Dread class was getting a level bonus to intimidate instead of 1/2 level bonus.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #119, Aberrant archetype was not getting the correct number of customization points when leveling up.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #129. Updated the wording for the feats: Dark Allure & Dark Authority to the latest book text.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #128. Added the missing stance "Chronal Fission".</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #1 LONG TIME outstanding issues with selecting maneuvers.  LW added a new feature that lets me finally check the IL of a class to validate if a maneuver/stance is valid to be added to a character.  This means that when you have a level 1 PoW class and select maneuvers it will not display level two maneuvers as being valid to add to your character. Thanks LW for this new feature!</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #133. Mystic levels will now correctly count towards Martial Disciple levels for feat Pre-Req's.</li>
<li>Path of War Divergent Paths (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #132. Medic class was not able to print manuevers/stances. In addition disciple level for Pre-Req of feats was not working correctly.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #120. Warder class was getting both Dex and Int as a bonus to the Combat Reflexes feat.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #107. This is a global change to how PoW works.  Stances where not being counted towards meeting the prerequisite of maneuvers. In example if you had a Borken Blade stance and wanted to take a broken blade maneuver that required 1 broken blade maneuver the stance was not counting. This is now fixed for all PoW classes.</li>
<li>Path of War Fixes (AranthisDrallidur) - Issue #124. Martial Training I - Fixed the glitches when trying to choose maneuvers in some disciplines. The feat is now implemented as per the official errata, allowing a choice of initiator attribute (cha, wis, int). Doing this fixes the bug, which apparently was related to trying to pull attributes off of discipline related skills that had physical attributes instead of mental ones.</li>
<li>Path of War Fixes (AranthisDrallidur) - Issue #124. Deadly Agility - Fixed timing issues. For some reason this feat was running at First/10000 instead of Post-Levels/10000 like Mythic Weapon Finesse. This prevents DA from working with anything that adds a finesse tag to a weapon, e.g. Daisho Expertise.</li>
<li>Path of War Fixes (AranthisDrallidur) - Issue #124. Daisho Expertise - Fixed it so the weapons use dex to hit, as per the feat text, and added fixes to the damage dice modification. This solves a lot of issues with the feat, including its use on large or small-sized katanas or bokken, which were being explicitly set to 1d10.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Modern Path (Frodie) - Added the ability to use USD currency instead of gold.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Changed a few adjustment names to be more standard. Added a Path of War header section to the adjustment area.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustment (ShadowChemosh) - The "Generic, Tracker" adjustment has been enhanced with a dropdown to reset with nights rest or no reset. It defaults to no reset which is what it does currently. In addition a usage dropdown selection on the adjustment lets you set the tracker to be <strong>/day</strong> or <strong>/week</strong> or whatever. Finally removed the dropdown to select the tracker. Instead the tracker on the In-Play tab gets its data directly from the attached adjustment.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added a new adjustment called "Class, Favored Class Bonus" which will let you choose a second FCB to gain a bonus in each level. This will not work with all FCB.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added new adjustment called "Class, Favored Class Bonus Adjust" that will let you increase/decrease the the amount of bonus a FCB gives.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Enhance the adjustment "Ability Score (Temp), Type" to have a "Inherent" bonus type.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added new "Class, Max Spell Level" adjustment to allow increasing the current spell level a class can cast.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Started adding File Constants to files. Removed load once logic. Used the new auto constants to globally tag all Things with PFS User OK in a user file. This makes sure everything stays consistant.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Added more file constants to enforce valid Unique ID's. Fixed some invalid ID's and setup load mods to silence the errors since the Things are all bootstrapped.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Added PW constant logic to PoW Feats and Expanded Feats.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v1.14 November 24, 2017</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>PFS Validation Errors (ShadowChemosh) - Really really fixed all the issues. Or at least I HOPE so!!!!</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Conferred Adjustment (ShadowChemosh) - Beastform Mutagen fixes: Set rake to give two attacks.  Web DC now includes Class Levels into its DC calcualtions instead of only racial HD.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Equipment (ShadowChemosh) - "- Custom Magic Item -" now adds it custom cost and weight to your character.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - #119 More Aegis updates.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fully implemented the Deep Crystal weapon material.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Standardized all the Damage Reduction abilities into the "Unversial Things" files including making all the tags the same.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Created a new "xxSetupDR" procedure to make all DR work exactly the same and make future ones easier to add.</li>
</ul>


<strong>v1.13 November 21, 2017</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>PFS Validation Errors (ShadowChemosh) - Went to a more LARGE scale massive fix. If the Thing was not specifically related to a 3PP book or option it was marked as valid for PFS. This means the PURPLE warning message will still appear and you must have turned on the SOURCE (ie Option in Configure Your Hero) to even see these Things. But all the other "RED" errors should be gone now. Unless you are really trying to use Ultimate Psionics for PFS... ;)</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Conferred Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Re-wrote the "alchemist: Beastform Mutagens" to prevent all the double activation of abilities. In addition the logic now for the dropdown's display on the In-Play tab and is all turned on/off with single activation instead of requiring 2 to 4 activation's when it was individual adjustments.</li>

<strong>v1.12 November 20, 2017</strong>

<strong>Bug Fixes</strong>
<ul>
<li>PFS Validation Errors (ShadowChemosh) - Additional fixes to prevent the validation errors from appearing for PFS characters.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - [Fixed] The Mind Shield, non-tower shield version, is implemented with a Max Dex of +0. I believe this is supposed to be no Max Dex as opposed to +0 Max Dex.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Added missing "Wilder" concentration skill. <strong>NOTE: It appears that the base Concentration value for Psionic classes is not correct. I am reporting the issue to LW to fix. My conentration skills simply display the value LW calculates.</strong></li>
<li>Conferred Adjustment (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed "Alchemist: Grand Beatform Mutagen" from turning on both Pounce & Rake when selecting Rake.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Pricing of modern items should all reflect as; 10 USD equals 1 GP. So basically $1 = 1 S.P. I did have a mechanic to change everything over to $, but I took it out ATM until I can add it to the 1st files. So it can be an optional choice to see $ or GP.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Went through all the gear and item powers and made sure they all work. Currently I am working on magic items.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Computer devices, when equipped, will mark all Knowledge skill as "trained". Computer devices are containers that can only hold software and have a weight limit (to make them like a hard drive). There are also purchasable upgrades for computer devices. The "Spell Apps" also seem to work and can be loaded to any computer device.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - I took off the trackers from firearms, (it was just too much). Made the firearm damage and kick options to default to off. You can still click it on if you want.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - The various feats, skills etc. that had the same name but with (MSRD) at the end to show a difference. They were renamed but do the same thing, just a new name. Hopefully this will help when mixing in the MSDR material with MP material.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Re-organized the universal items (gear, feats, traits, etc.) in proper location and category. Firearm addons that are in the custom magic item area, (Item Powers), were re-named Weapon Mods -  xyz, to group them together and kind of get them out of the way. The name will adjust to a short name once taken.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Fixed a bug that the Modern Hero wasn't getting class skills. Cleaned up the names of the other classes.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Added the Modern template that opens up a config so everyone can use modern talents. Made the modern talents run off hit dice rather than class level, so anyone can use them.</li>
<li>Modern Files (Frodie) - Check all the sci-fi stuff and they seems to work.</li>

<li>PFS (ShadowChemosh) - Added new logic to prevent PFS things from being locked out simply because its in a user file. LW added logic that causes anything done in a user file to be locked out for PFS characters. A "warning" message still appears no matter what I do now for adding anything from the Community Pack.</li>

<li>RGG Dragonrider Class (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #122. The Dragon Steed race type was not being added to the dragon steed minions. This prevented many of the races bases stats from calculating correctly (ie saves, BAB, skill points, hit points). Enhanced all to the script logic to better standards.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Starfinder (ShadowChemosh) - New GM Starfinder configuration option (Community Pack->GM Section->Starfinder GM->Starfinder) that allows for converting a Pathfinder monster to Starfinder rules. THIS IS MEANT FOR GMs NOT PLAYERS! I did my best to implement the rules on page 498 of the Starfinder Core book. When you activate this new option Skills will be consolidated into Starfinder skills. In example if you get a bonus to "Handle Animal" skill you will see this as a situational bonus for "Survial". In addition a new 'Starfinder' tab will appear that requires you to choose an option. You need to decide to use Pathfinder multiple attacks or Starfinder's single attack logic. Finally the Starfinder tab will also let you add a "Resolve" pool that will display on the In-Play tab.</li>
<li>RGG Talented Monk(Eilserves) - Added more talents. Added additional talents, simplified some code.</li>

If you need the same selection of energy types on a "different" Pick use the custom expression "component.SelectHelp &amp; Psionics.PsiActEne". I have extended the tags PsiActEne.? onto the selection helpers.</li>

<li>Gallery of Evil module (ShadowChemosh) - Added in the missing "Numerian Leaf Armor" item that has slightly different rules than the Pathfinder version of Leaf armor.</li>
<li>Path of War Expanded (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #68. When using the Hidden Blade archetype and a normal Rogue (ie not Unchained Rogue) HL would toss an error.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #73. Fixed item powers Parrying, Floating & Quickness to correctly check for if they are equipped or not. This will also prevent the error message from appearing for these item powers.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Classes (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #64. Adjusted "Superstition" rage power logic based on LW changes to the core Superstition rage power. The bonus will no longer be doubled.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #63. Wild Talent feat and Unlocked Talent feat where not getting Power Points and powers to print on the character sheet. Sent email to LW with question about how to cause Powers/Power Points to appear on printed character sheet. As a work around for now I have added logic that will cause the "Wild Talent" feat to display a number/day tracker to the printed character sheet only to represent the characters total power points. In addition the unlocked talent will modify the first non-manifester class it finds when "printing". This allows the information to get to the printed character sheet. Those not printing characters sheets should see no difference.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #57. Psionic Archetypes that switch the manifester ability score are getting the ability score instead of modifier added to the DC of Powers. I have reported this bug to LW and hopefully it is fixed. This was reported with the Dread class using the Fearmonger archetype. LW ticket number 110317.</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #16 Prc Psychic Fist. The Psychic Fist PrC now allows a selection of either manifesting powers or increasing your existing manifesting class. Blah it took WAY too many hours to get this to work correctly... =(</li>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #9. Aegis Aberrant Archetype was giving incorrect natural armor bonus as the character levels. The max at level 20 is now +5.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Fixed #12. The following archetypes would prevent adding disciplines after removing them: Warlord: Vanguard Commander; Warlord: Steelfist Commando; Warder: Dervish Defender.</li>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Updated the Advanced Study feat to note that it does not currently allow for selecting a discipline outside your allowed ones. Just didn't have the extra time required to fully fix this issue.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Adjustment "Race, Size Category" was not source marked to the community.</li>
</ul>
<strong>New Features</strong>
<ul>
<li>Ultimate Psionics (delawless) - Added new Dual Disciple archetype for the Psion class.</li>
<li>Warpriest Archetypes Unchained (ShadowChemosh) - Added a new "Sacred Fist Unchained" archetype for the Warpriest.  This archetype uses the Unchained Monk Flurry of Blow rules instead of the normal chained monk FoB rules.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - For concentration skills added the situational note for the the elven ART Arcane Focus. For concentration:magus skill added situational notes about Spell Combat.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Added new Conferred Adjustment called "Magus: Spell Combat". When added will have a new In-Play option appear that lets you you set the penalty to attack and turn on/off Spell Combat.  When on the correct Concentration bonus will be calculated, attack penalty applied if you set the counter, and will also correctly adjust the the Attack Values for a Weapon and the "Touch Attack" weapon when set as TWF on the Weapon tab.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Issue #71. Added new adjustment "Race, Custom Ability". That will add a generic racial ability to a creature and let you give it a unique name and a description text up to 100 characters.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments (ShadowChemosh) - Implemented Request #72. Added new "Awaken (Vermin)" spell adjustment designed to allow the awakening of a vermin. This version of Awaken opens up the Int ability score and sets it to a value of 1.  This is often requested because of the "Vermin Heart" feat. This is not allowed for PFS.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Made most Eberron tag groups to be Dynanmic in the .1st file. This allows home editors to add new tags without needing to modify the .1st file which is bad.  As the .1st file gets overwritten each update and any modifications would get lost.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Added a place holder for Mark of Death.  I didn't add any abilities but left the frame work in place allowing GM's to easily add in the abilities if they wish for home games.</li>
<li>Eberron Campaign Setting (ShadowChemosh) - Changed the Custom Expression on "Least Dragonmark" to NOT use Thingid.? tags and instead use Dragonmark.Tab to include the Marks. This allows an easier way for someone to add in New marks if they wish.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Found lots of left over "debug" statements in the files.  Removed them as they just cause unneeded overhead.</li>

<strong>Data File Authoring</strong>
<ul>
<li>Path of War (ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. I combined the different PoW Disciplines Selection Helpers and Spell Schools into a new component set. This merges all the logic into a single Thing and allows for a new editor tab to define new Disciplines. I deprecated the old Discipline Spell-Schools and merged all its logic into the new PWDisc component. I added logic in PWDisc to use linkage to link to the Disciplines class skill or skills.  Up to 5 different skills can be selected. I changed Ultimate Psionics & Path of War skills to be "Unique" so that the linkages would work. Changed new Discipline tab to have it ignore non-helpful skills in the linkage.</li>
<li>Path of War Extended (ShadowChemosh) - Modified the PWManList to be able to use ArchCntAs tag group so that it can change itself to either class. Updated the Editor tab for Man Lists to be able to assign these tags. Cleaned up some of the XML. Updated a Class ability to not hard-code the reference to cHelpRog.</li>
<li>ShadowChemosh Adjustments PFS (ShadowChemosh) - Created a new procedure (S2PFSName) to centralize all the logic for adding additional text to for the PFS Boons.</li>
<li>(ShadowChemosh) - Redo of some of the community editor tabs to make use of the new Group editor tab logic. This is helpful for the new PoW editor tabs added in the 3PP Pack.</li>
